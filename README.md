This is a basic code that takes a csv file with stocks and converts them to a tradeable format.

It selects the algos that we use and it also selects the broker, broker code, transaction type etc.

The result is a well formatted file that gets uploaded to our OEMS platform (Enfusion) and all trades get transmitted to Morgan Stanley in bulk after they pass the pre-trade compliance checks.
